Hi , 
I am vivan, and I am going to talk about arduino.

Arduino is, a micro-controller, and an open-source hardware and software platform for coding, creating fun projects and it is also used for real problems such as an automatic sanitizer disperser can be made using arduino. Arduino is educational and fun !  You can construct a simple circuit or an automatic robot and start coding !

Thanks !
